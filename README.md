# Site-Storage for a Few Users

Hello! My name is Paul and i am newby developer on my way to perfection!
This is my Ruby on Rails Web-Storage Site.
_____________________________________________________________________________
Description: 
It's a web-page created as a test Ruby project to keep some data for a few different users.
Particularly this version, I named FriendsApp to store the list of Friends. You may log in to the App, and then record/edit/add/delete any Friend from a list you created before.
You have access only to the records you did. You can not see/edit/delete or somehow else interact with the data you didn't input. You may also delete your account you signed up with. There is a possibility to log in under different accounts, and it helps different users to store their own data at the same App.

Instructions:
Open the link below.

Sign Up using your email and create your password. Then click Add Friend or New Friend. Input necessary data, such as name, email, phone, twitter. Save it.
You may edit Friend details or even delete by clicking the name of each Friend. You may edit your profile or delete it. You may try to create another account and log in.
Then you may see that the data you've inputted before not accessible for a new user.
